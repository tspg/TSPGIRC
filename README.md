[![Build Status](https://jenkins.csnxs.uk/buildStatus/icon?job=TSPGIRC)](https://jenkins.csnxs.uk/job/TSPGIRC)

A Spigot plugin that provides an IRC relay.

Configuration is located in `plugins/TSPGIRC/config.yml` and is pretty self-explanatory.

The bot is controlled using the `/irc` command in game.
